                    <p>This website's main purpose was a digital biography or a big CV for author's education and jobs. The website contains the author's personal informations; his professional and academical experiences; his CV and portfolio for his job; their books and articles for educational purposes; and a small blog where the author occasionally rambles about his interests and hobbies.</p>
                    <p>The site is written with zero experience about web-development before. The code contains vanilla javascript for fancy purposes; plain html and css for the structure of the website, and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> as SSG to create future html pages and configure them easily. The site is currently being hosted with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>.</p>
                    <p>The design and some functions was inspired by various sites, mainly from  <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://web.evanchen.cc/">Evan Chen's website</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>. </p>
                    <p>Learning html was very easy; css boxes, flex and grid display was a bit tricky but nevertheless I learned it. Also since I already had experience with python, I already could use basic javascript. The most painful thing was to set up jekyll and github pages. The jekyll documentation, in my personal opinion, sucks and is very ambigious when explaining stuff. Moreover the templating language's documentation that jekyll uses, that is  <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">liquid</a> also sucks so I had to browse hundreds of forums to fix my problems.</p>
                    <p>You can visit website's <a href="https://github.com/JosephMehdiyev/joseph-web">github page</a> to see read the entire code with a bit of documentation about its development and function.</p>
