                    <p>Cormat is a 3D math software intended for visualizing mathematical function graphs, also for physical simulations in the future.
                    The language used for this project is the mix of C++ and C. C code is used for mainly external libraries and APIs such as
                    OpenGl and GLFW. To learn more about the technical side of the project, please visit <a href="https://github.com/JosephMehdiyev/cormat">cormat github</a></p>
                    <p>The 3D API used for the project, OpenGL, is in fact not easy to learn nor understand. I have spent lots of time just understanding the principles
                    behind the API. Therefore the development was very slow and painful. But I believe I did a great job handling this monstrosity. Currently, I am
                    busy with my first book about statistics, so I don't give enough love for this project, but I am planing to keep developing it.</p>
                    <p>Currently the main part of the project is almost finished. I am working on front end user interface with ImGui.</p>
