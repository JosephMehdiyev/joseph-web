                    <p>I like to take my notes in Latex in a proper  book style. The notes have simple theorems with some exercises and their proofs/solutions.
                    You can find LATEX source code of each notes in my github account. I stopped taking notes in LaTeX, since I started to believe they are useless for my learning. They look cool though at least.</p>
