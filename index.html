                    <p>This is the homepage of Joseph's (Yusif Mehdiyev) website, a site fully written and designed by Joseph for educational and professional purposes.</p>
                    <p> Using the navigation bars of the page, the reader may visit various pages of the website. Information about my <a href="/about/CV.pdf">CV</a>, <a href="/projects/main.html">Projects</a> and <a href="/publications/main.html"> Publications</a> can be found in the navigation pages. I recommend reading the website with a laptop/desktop since telephone version of the website is a bit clunky. Be warned!</p>
                    <p> If you want to know more about how this site is written, you may visit my  <a href="https://github.com/JosephMehdiyev/joseph-web">github</a> page or read the site's   <a href="/projects/web.html">This website</a> page. To be precise and simple, The site is written with pure javascript, html and css. I use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>, a Static Site generator written in Ruby, to generate my html pages. Note that the website is still in development so there may be aesthetical or functional issues when you read the pages.  As written above, I recommend using the desktop/laptop version of the site for the best experience. I am not that interested in web development and I have other projects in my mind, so this site probably stay the same for centuries.  </p>
                    <h2 class="h2-structure">About Joseph</h2> 
                    <p>I am a high-school student currently studying his final year in Azerbaijan. I am also enthusiastic about mathematics, programming and some cliche games (TF2 mostly). You may find more information about me in my <a href="/about/main.html">About</a> page.</p>
                    <p> About my equipments, I mainly use my somewhat modern laptop with <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>. I use <a href="https://i3wm.org">i3wm</a> as window manager, <a href="https://librewolf.net/">Librewolf</a> as my browser and <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>/<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS code</a> as my IDEs. I will soon release my dot files in my github page, you may find my configurations there.</p>
