                    <p>This is the homepage of Joseph's (Yusif Mehdiyev) website, a site fully written and designed by Joseph for educational and professional purposes.</p>
                    <p>From the navigation bars that are in the top and the right side of the page, the reader may find information about my <a href="pages/CV">CV</a>, <a href="pages/projects.html">Projects</a> and <a href="pages/publications.html"> Publications</a>.</p>

                    <h1 class="content-title">About the web</h1>
                    <p>The site is written with html, css and pure javascript with no experience about web development before. I got inspired the web's design from various sites such as <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/">3blue1brown</a> and <a href="https://web.evanchen.cc/">Evan Chen's web</a>.</p>
                    <p>Reader may find various technical and aesthetic issues in the site. If you find a problem, or want to share some recommendations about the web's design, you can report it in my <a href="">github page</a>. Since I am busy with my other projects and this site is not my main priority, I won't be able to respond quickly to the requests.</p>
                    <p>You can find source code and progress of this website  in this  <a href="github link here">github</a> link.</p>
