                    <p>This is the homepage of Joseph's (Yusif Mehdiyev) website, a site fully written and designed by Joseph for educational and professional purposes.</p>
                    <p> Using the navigation bars of the page, the reader may visit various pages of the website. Information about my <a href="/about/CV.pdf">CV</a>, <a href="/projects/main.html">Projects</a> and <a href="/publications/main.html"> Publications</a> can be found in the navigation pages. I recommend reading the website with a laptop/desktop since telephone version of the website is a bit clunky. Be warned!</p>
                    <p> If you want to know more about how this site is written, you may visit my  <a href="https://github.com/JosephMehdiyev/joseph-web">github</a> page or read the site's   <a href="/projects/web.html">This website</a> page. Note that the website is still in development so there may be aesthetical or functional issues when you read the pages.  As written above, I recommend using the desktop/laptop version of the site for the best experience. I am not that interested in web development and I have other projects in my mind, so this site probably stay the same for centuries.  </p>
