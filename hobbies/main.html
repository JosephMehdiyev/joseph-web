                    <p>I was born in Baku, Azerbaijan in 2006 March. In 2024 June, I graduated from an average public school
                    with all 5 except for one 4. I have studied Maths for one year at ADA university, Azerbaijan and currently I am studying Maths and Stats at University of Glasgow with full scholarship including monthly allowance.

                    <p>I like to self study and practice mathematics by my myself. I also have lots of experience in proof based math olympiads, I even 
                    participated in my country's olympiads (IMO, BMO, BJMO and so on) selection tests. Well, I couldn't get selected, but I still believe it is a
                    great achievement.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I am discovering multiple areas of mathematics. I am learning about Differential Geometry, Topology and Tensor algebra</p>
                    <p>I have experience in programming languages such as C, C++, Python, Lua and R. My preferred language is C++. 
                   </p>
                    <p>I also like video games such as Team Fortress 2, Portal series, L2D2, Factorio, League of Legend,  Teamfight Tactics, all the souls series (especially Dark Souls 3), CSGO (Master Guardian I) and so on. Nowadays I don't play games that much, simply because I don't have any time.</p>
