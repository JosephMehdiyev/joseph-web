            Foundations of Mathematics aims to transition students to university level mathematics through development of abstract structures and reasoning skills, the interplay between algebra and geometry, and to ensure students have a strong command of the basics of mathematics that is crucial to our degree programmes. A strong focus throughout the course will be placed on developing mathematical communication skills.         \\

            This course is a first introduction to real analysis. The common thread running through the course is the notion of limit. The precise definition of this notion will be given for both sequences and series. It is an essential course for intending honours students. The emphasis is on developing and applying standard techniques of proof to give rigorous arguments from basic definitions.            \\
