                    <p>I was born in Baku, Azerbaijan back in 2006 March. In 2024 June, I graduated from 12 numbered public school
                    with 3.95~ GPA (a specific teacher, in fact, did not like me). Currently, I am studying mathematics degree in one of the best universities of my country,
                    ADA university with one year 100% scholarship. I am planning to studying abroad starting from 2025/2026 academic year. If you want to contact me, please
                    visit <a href="/joseph-web/contact/main.html">Contact</a> Page.</p>
                    <p>I like to self study and practice mathematics all my myself. I already know Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, basic Number Theory,
                    Basic Graph theory, and currently I am trying to learn real analysis. I also have lots of experience in proof based math olympiads, I even 
                    participated in my country's olympiads (IMO, BMO, BJMO and so on) selection tests. Well, I couldn't get selected, but I still believe it is a
                    great achievement.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I am learning about how academics function. I am even writing a (amateurish) statistics book! You can find about it more in <a href="/joseph-web/publications/main.html">Publications</a> Page.</p>
                    <p>I have experience in programming languages such as C, C++, Python, Lua and R. In fact, I am training myself in competitive programming currently.
                    I want to participate ICPC. I also have plenty of projects. You can find all of them in my github account.</p>
                    <p>I also like video games such as Team Fortress 2, League of Legends,  Teamfight Tactics, all the souls series (especially Dark Souls 3) and so on.
                    Sadly, I had to downgrade my computer for personal reasons, now I can't play these beatiful work of arts.</p>
