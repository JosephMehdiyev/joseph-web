                    <p>I was born in Baku, Azerbaijan back in 2006 March. In 2024 June, I graduated from 12 numbered public school
                    with 3.95~ GPA (a specific teacher, in fact, did not like me). Currently, I am studying mathematics degree in one of the best universities of my country,
                    ADA university with one year 100% scholarship. I am planning to studying abroad starting from 2025/2026 academic year. If you want to contact me, please
                    visit <a href="/contact/main.html">Contact</a> Page.</p>
                    <p>I like to self study and practice mathematics all by my myself. I have already studied important subjects such as Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics and so on. I also have some experience in Graph Theory and Number Theory. I also have lots of experience in proof based math olympiads, I even 
                    participated in my country's olympiads (IMO, BMO, BJMO and so on) selection tests. Well, I couldn't get selected, but I still believe it is a
                    great achievement.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I am learning about how academics function. I am even writing a (amateurish) statistics book! You can find about it more in <a href="/publications/main.html">Publications</a> Page.</p>
                    <p>I have experience in programming languages such as C, C++, Python, Lua and R. My preferred language is C++, and I use python and R only for statistics, ML and data science. Moreover I am training myself in competitive programming currently.
                    I want to participate ICPC. I also have plenty of projects. You can find all of them in my github account.</p>
                    <p>I also like video games such as Team Fortress 2, Factorio, League of Legends (Diamond 1 rank),  Teamfight Tactics, all the souls series (especially Dark Souls 3), CSGO(Master Guardian I) and so on. Nowadays I don't play games that much, simply because I don't have any time.</p>
