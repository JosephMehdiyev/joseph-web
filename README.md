This repository contains the source files of my website https://josephmehdiyev.github.io/joseph-web/. Everything I used for my website is here.



## About the Website 
The website's main purpose is anonline, big CV for the author. The website contains the author's **projects**, **books** , **the author's experience and knowledge** and so on. It is very easy to navigate the website using either top or side navigation bar.




## How is website written?

The website uses **html**, **css/scss** and **vanilla javascript**. No fancy frameworks are used. However, since the website is used, **Ruby based Jekyll** is used to generate the extra pages of the website.
